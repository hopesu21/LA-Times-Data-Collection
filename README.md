# LA-Times-Data-Collection
This is a repository for a final group project for IS 262 at UCLA. The internet has made news media more accessible but has also led to the spread of conspiracy theories and misinformation. The dangerous repercussions of the spread of misinformation underscore the importance of data management practices in news media, where journalists must quickly report and share fact-based news to combat the spread of harmful misinformation. Our group collected data on a sample of 100 LA Times articles to learn more about the data collection and management methods of the LA Times. Specifically, we focused on COVID-19 data, Arrest data, Homicide data and Housing data.
